<h1>Gurgle</h1>
<h2>Guess those words</h2>
<p>
  Tap letters on the keyboard to enter a guess. Use the <b>Back</b>
  key to backspace. When you have finished a guess, tap
  the <b>Enter</b> key. If you have guessed the word correctly, music
  will play and a short message will appear. Tap the display to stop
  the music, or tap the word for it's definition.
</p>
<h2>Display colours</h2>
<p>
  Letters which are in the word but in the wrong place will turn
  yellow. If they are in the right place they will turn green. If they
  are not in the word they will turn grey. Keep trying until you have
  guessed the word. The display will start again from the top if you
  run out of guesses. The colours may be changed by selecting
  <b>Highlight colours</b> in the menu.
</p>
<h2>Refresh</h2>
<p>
  Tap the <b>Refresh</b> button in the toolbar to clear the display and
  guess another word. Words are chosen at random from a list, and are
  checked that they haven't been used recently.
</p>
<h2>Meaning</h2>
<p>
  Tap the word once it has been guessed to display the meaning.
</p>
<h2>Share</h2>
<h3>Image</h3>
<p>
  Share an image of the current display.
</p>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>
  Display an alphanumeric code and a QR code which represents a new
  sequence of words to guess. This code may be shared with another
  copy of Gurgle on another phone to set the same sequence of
  words. Tapping the QR code button on the dialog shares the QR code
  image. Tapping the code button shares the alphanumeric code.
</p>
<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>
  Select coloured theme from the <b>Theme</b> button in the toolbar.
</p>
<h2>Language</h2>
<p>
  Select <b>Language</b> from the menu.
</p>
<h2>Get code</h2>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>
  Enter the code shared by another copy of Gurgle to set the same
  sequence of words. If a game is in progress tap the refresh button
  to start the new sequence. You may also make up your own code. It
  doesn't need the two equals symbols on the end (=), but will fail
  with just one.
</p>
<h3>QR code</h3>
<p>
  Opens the camera app on the phone to take a photo of a QR code. The
  app will attempt to decode it. There are plenty of very good QR code
  and barcode scanner apps that do a better job.
</p>
<h3>Receiving a code</h3>
<p>
  If the app is sent a code or a QR code image it will set a new
  sequence of words if the code is decoded successfully. This does not
  affect the current game. If a game is in progress tap the refresh
  button to start the new sequence.
</p>

<h2>Highlight colours</h2>
<p>
  A dialog will pop up showing two guesses, one containing some
  letters in the word in the wrong place and a correct guess, and two
  spectrums. Change the colour of the letters in the wrong place by
  tapping on the top spectrum, and the correct letters with the bottom
  spectrum.  The <b>Reset</b> button will restore the default colours,
  The <b>Cancel</b> button changes nothing, and the <b>OK</b> button
  accepts the changes.
</p>
