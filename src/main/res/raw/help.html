  you have guessed the word correctly, music will play and a short
  message will appear. Tap the word for it's definition.

  Letters which are in the word but in the wrong place will turn
  yellow. If they are in the right place they will turn green. If they
  are not in the word they will turn grey. Keep trying until you have
  guessed the word. The display will scroll up if you run out of
  guesses. The colours may be changed by selecting
  <b>Highlight colours</b> in the menu.
</p>

<p>
  Long press on a letter in the current guess to lock it, which will
  turn it grey. Long press again to remove the lock. Locked letters
  will be skipped when entering and deleting letters. Long presses on
  letters not part of the current guess will pop up a menu as below.
</p>

  words. Tapping the QR code button on the dialog shares the QR code
  image. Tapping the code button shares the alphanumeric code.

<h2>Dictionary</h2>
<p>
  Select the dictionary to look up a word meaning. Wictionary (online)
  is built
  in, <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/itkach.aard2/">Aard2</a>
  and <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.reimardoeffinger.quickdic/">Quickdic</a>
  are apps which can be installed
  from <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a>.

<h2>Language</h2>
<p>
  Select <b>Language</b> from the menu.
</p>
<h2>Get code</h2>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>
  Enter the code shared by another copy of Gurgle to set the same
  sequence of words. If a game is in progress tap the refresh button
  to start the new sequence. You may also make up your own code. It
  doesn't need the two equals symbols on the end (=), but will fail
  with just one.
</p>
<h3>QR code</h3>
<p>
  Opens the camera app on the phone to take a photo of a QR code. The
  app will attempt to decode it. There are plenty of very good QR code
  and barcode scanner apps that do a better job.
</p>
<h3>Receiving a code</h3>
<p>
  If the app is sent a code or a QR code image it will set a new
  sequence of words if the code is decoded successfully. This does not
  affect the current game. If a game is in progress tap the refresh
  button to start the new sequence.
</p>

<h2>Highlight colours</h2>
<p>
  A dialog will pop up showing two guesses, one containing some
  letters in the word in the wrong place and a correct guess, and
  three spectrums. Change the colour of the letters in the wrong place
  by tapping on the top spectrum, and the correct letters with the
  middle spectrum. Change the shade of grey of the letters not in the
  word with the bottom spectrum. The <b>Reset</b> button will restore
  the default colours, The <b>Cancel</b> button changes nothing, and
  the <b>OK</b> button accepts the changes.
